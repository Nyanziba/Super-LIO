## Overview

</p>


Super-LIO is a robust and efficient LiDAR–Inertial Odometry (LIO) system designed for real-time and large-scale autonomous navigation. It introduces a compact and structured mapping strategy that enables predictable correspondence search and stable state estimation. The system is validated through extensive real-world experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.

## Quickly Run

### Requirements

Ubuntu 20.04 · ROS Noetic · Eigen · PCL

### Dependencies

glog · TBB · ros-noetic-jsk-rviz-plugins

```bash
sudo apt install libgoogle-glog-dev libtbb-dev ros-noetic-jsk-rviz-plugins
```

### Build & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Liansheng-Wang/Super-LIO.git
cd Super-LIO
catkin_make

source devel/setup.bash 
roslaunch super_lio Livox_mid360.launch

```

#### 🔁 Relocalization Mode
Super-LIO supports relocalization using a pre-built map, allowing the system to resume localization from a saved map without restarting the mapping process.
This mode is useful for long-term deployment, repeated missions, or recovery after tracking loss.

Before running relocalization, please make sure that:
- A map has been previously saved to disk.

```bash
cd PATH_2_Super-LIO
source devel/setup.bash 
roslaunch super_lio relocation.launch
```


## Datasets
<p align="center">

</p>

Super-LIO is evaluated on multiple real-world datasets covering diverse environments,
including indoor, outdoor, and large-scale scenes.

> **TODO**: Dataset download links and detailed descriptions will be provided in the future.
